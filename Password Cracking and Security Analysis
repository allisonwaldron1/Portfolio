Description: Conducted password cracking experiments and security analysis to assess the strength of passwords and identify vulnerabilities in a simulated network environment.

Key Contributions:
  - Simulated network environment setup with VirtualBox, incorporating Windows, Metasploitable VMs, and Kali Linux for penetration testing.
  - Utilized tools such as John the Ripper to conduct password cracking experiments and assess password strength and hash algorithms.
  - Analyzed results to identify vulnerabilities and proposed security enhancements to mitigate risks.
